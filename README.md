ðŸŽ¬ End-to-End Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that seeks to determine whether a given piece of text conveys a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. In this project, we work with the IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset, a widely used benchmark containing 50,000 highly polarized reviews (25,000 for training and 25,000 for testing), each labeled as positive or negative.

The objective of this project is to build an end-to-end deep learning pipeline that automatically classifies the sentiment of movie reviews. We leverage Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to capture sequential dependencies in text, enabling the model to effectively learn patterns that distinguish positive from negative reviews.
